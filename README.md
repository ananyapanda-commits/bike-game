# bike-game
A console application game development project is the Bike Race Game in C++. 
It is engaging, easy to play, and shows how to use SDL and other C++ programming language capabilities. 
I have applied visuals in the game to make it more realistic in order to improve its aesthetics. 
The project's primary focus is on using SDL, a well-liked 2D game graphics, in C++. The C++ project format is used to write the source code for the Bike Race Game, which is then compiled using the GCC compiler in the Code::Blocks IDE. 
Eight user-defined header files make up the game's source code, and several user-defined functions are included in this project.
